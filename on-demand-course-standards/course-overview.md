# Course overview



## Course overview requirements

**Requirement**. Each course begins with an overview, providing an outline, a list of prerequisites, and clear learning objectives.

**Guidelines**. The course overview must be accessible at the beginning of the course and throughout. If there is a primary technical instructor, the overview can be delivered as an instructor intro video.

**Example.** Refer to [**Unit Testing On-Demand**](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/unit-testing/welcome-to-unit-testing-5min/introduction-to-unit-testing?page=1) for an example of a course overview delivered through an instructor intro video.
