# Course overview

## Course overview requirements

**Requirement**. Each course includes a course overview that features an outline of the course, a list of course pre-requisites, and a clear idea of what learners will learn in the course.

**Guidelines**. The course overview must be accessible at the beginning of the course and throughout. If there is a primary technical instructor, the overview can be delivered as an instructor intro video.

**Example.** Refer to [**Unit Testing On-Demand**](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/unit-testing/welcome-to-unit-testing-5min/introduction-to-unit-testing?page=1) for an example of a course overview delivered through an instructor intro video.
