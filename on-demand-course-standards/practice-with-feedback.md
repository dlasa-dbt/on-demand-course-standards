# Practice with feedback

## Practice requirements

**Requirement**. Each course must give learners the opportunity to practice new skills and receive feedback.

**Guidelines.** Assignments include clear expectations and completion criteria. Hands-on Lab instructions and code snippets are provided, when appropriate.

**Example**. Refer to the [**Semantic Layer On-Demand**](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/semantic-layer/semantic-models/semantic-models?page=7) for examples of practice assignments with clear expectations, instructions, code snippets, and support materials.
