# Assessment

## Assessment requirements

**Requirement**. There are several categories of assessment activities, including summative or formative. Each type of assessment serves a purpose, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. Assessment activities allow learners to demonstrate progress toward learning outcomes. All courses must include ongoing and frequent assessment, and the relationship between learning outcomes and assessment must be clear.

**Guidelines.** Design activities that align closely with the learning outcomes of each lesson in a course. Ensure that the assessment activities are appropriate for the audience and time frame. Provide feedback and rubrics to help learners recognize where they are doing well and how to improve. For summative assessments, like quizzes, include two or more answer options for multiple choice questions, and use a consistent number of answer options that do not include clues as to which answer is correct. Use **plausible detractors,** and provide immediate feedback, and use [**rejoinders**](https://dbt-learn.gitbook.io/on-demand-learning-fieldbook/v/on-demand-learning-glossary#rejoinder). Do not ask questions about topics not covered in the course material.

**Examples.** Refer to the [**dbt Fundamentals Quiz**](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/dbt-fundamentals-quiz/dbt-fundamentals-badge/dbt-fundamentals-badge?page=1) course for an example of a well-formatted quiz. Note: this quiz includes all of the knowledge checks from dbt Fundamentals in one assessment.
