# Assessment

## Assessment requirements

**Requirement**. Courses must include ongoing and frequent assessment and the relationship between learning outcomes and assessment must be clear.

**Guidelines.** Include two or more answer options for multiple choice questions, add plausible detractors, provide immediate feedback, and use rejoinders. Do not ask questions about topics not covered in the course material.

**Examples.** Refer to the [**dbt Fundamentals Quiz**](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/dbt-fundamentals-quiz/dbt-fundamentals-badge/dbt-fundamentals-badge?page=1) course for an example of a well-formatted quiz. Note: these are all of the knowledge checks from dbt Fundamentals in one assessment.
