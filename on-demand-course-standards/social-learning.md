# Social learning

## Social learning requirements

**Requirement**. Each course is designed to encourage interaction between learners.

**Guidelines.** Engage learners in higher-level thinking skills including critical and creative thinking, analysis, and problem-solving. Encourage learners to email the training team and/or join discussions on dbt Community Slack to connect with peers and get support.

**Example**. Refer to the [**dbt Fundamentals FAQ page**](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/dbt-fundamentals/welcome-to-dbt-fundamentals-5min/welcome?page=2) for an example of a call to action that promotes social learning. **Call to action:** _“Please reach out in the_ [_#learn-on-demand_](https://getdbt.slack.com/archives/C01DU491K1A/p1670356944621679) _channel in_ [_dbt Slack_](https://www.getdbt.com/community)_. We'd be happy to support you there.”_
