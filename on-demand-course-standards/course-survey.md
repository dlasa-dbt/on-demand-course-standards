# Course survey

## Course survey requirements

**Requirements**. Every public course must include a survey to gather specific feedback on course content, course structure, course media, and delivery methods.

**Guidelines.** Use learner feedback to identify areas for improvement, to enhance learner engagement, and to inform course design decisions.

**Example**. Review the [**On-Demand Course Survey**](https://dbtlearn.typeform.com/to/Xq27dSf4?typeform-source=towksj49ul2.typeform.com) to see the data we collect for each course.
