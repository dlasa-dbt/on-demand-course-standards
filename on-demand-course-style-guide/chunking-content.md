# Chunking content

## Guidelines for chunking content

**Requirement**. Divide content into smaller, easily digestible pieces of information that are clear and meaningful on their own. Label chunks with descriptive headings that contrast with the main text to improve scannability.

**Guidelines.** Use clear headings and subheadings. Write short paragraphs. Incorporate visual elements: Use bullet points, numbered lists, and highlighted keywords to make chunks easier to scan and comprehend. [\[**Chunking Tips**\]](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/)
