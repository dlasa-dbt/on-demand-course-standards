## Guidelines for accessibility

**Requirement.** Ensure web content is accessible by adhering to the [**Four Principles of Accessibility: perceivability, operability, understandability, and robustness**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/). These principles are supported by testable success criteria and implementation techniques.

**Guidelines**: Provide accurate, synchronized captions for all prerecorded video content and transcripts for audio-only content. Provide alt text for non-text content, including images. Record videos in light mode only. **\[**[**W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)**]**.
