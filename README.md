Welcome to the On-Demand Learning Fieldbook. This resource offers a dynamic set of guidelines for creating engaging learning experiences that educate customers and build trust in data teams.

The guide supports the development of dbt Learn On-Demand public courses, which have been taken by nearly 170,000 learners. These courses consistently receive top Net Promoter Scores (NPS), exceeding SaaS industry training benchmarks.
